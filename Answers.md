Q1.
"Product" entity has a one-to-many relationship with the "Product_Category" entity. This relationship is established through the use of a foreign key in the "Product" entity, which is denoted as category_id in the schema. The category_id field in the "Product" entity is a reference to the id field in the "Product_Category" entity. 


Q2.
The foreign key constraint would ensure that the category_id field in the "Product" table always references a valid id value in the "Product_Category" table. This means that if a product is inserted into the "Product" table without a valid category_id value, the database would reject the insertion and return an error.
